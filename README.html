<h1>Self introduction</h1>

<p>I have a strong skill set related to platform engineering and devops.</p>

<p>I have built quote a number of internal devops services, tools and automation frameworks
covering various aspects of SDLC.</p>

<p>I can easily code on many programming languages including Python, Ruby, Perl, Raku, Powershell
and Golang.</p>

<p>I can mix building of custom frameworks with use of well known systems and tools.</p>

<p>I can not only code but make a solid system design acting as a ubiquitous mediator 
between ops, devs and architects.</p>

<p>I love to convert confusing and tangled systems into simple and easy to maintain.</p>

<p>I can and love write tests to all my code. I can write any sort of tests - unit tests,
integration tests, acceptance tests and UI tests.</p>

<p>I am very systematic and attentive to details. I love and I can document my code.</p>

<p>I can work both with legacy code, eventually bringing things in order, and 
yes I love to start  green fields projects :-)</p>

<p>I am familiar with system design, algorithm and data structure concepts.</p>

<p>I can always find a good balance in spending my work time to create a proper design, 
write quality code, sharing knowledge with other and writing documentations</p>

<p>I am the author of many open source automation frameworks and active member of Raku language community.</p>

<p>Following is my job history and achievements for the last 15 years</p>
