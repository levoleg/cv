# Aleksei Melezhik Devops CV

# Summary

I am devops with a strong development background. I tend to develop tools and automate everything rather then manually create stuff. I can code on many scripting languages including Perl (I used to be a Perl developer for many years), Ruby (not only limited to Rails and chef), Bash and Powershell. My current favourite langauge is Raku on which I do a lot of open source projects (Sparrow - Raku automation framework)
