# Aleksei Melezhik Devops and Developer CV

# Summary

Hi! I am devops with a strong development background.

I like to develop tools and automate everything rather then manually create stuff.
I can code on many scripting languages including Perl (I used to be a Perl developer for many years),
Ruby (not limited to Ruby on Rails and chef), Bash and Powershell.

My current favorite language is [Raku](http://raku.org/) on which I do a lot of open source projects.
The last one is - [SparrowHub.io](https://sparrowhub.io) - repository of devops and automation tool.

I can teach devops how to create quality tools and usually fill the gaps of lacking development experience
in every devops team I join.
