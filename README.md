# Cover letter

I have a strong skill set related to platform engineering and devops.

I have built quite a number of internal devops services, tools and automation frameworks
covering various aspects of SDLC.

I can easily code on many programming languages including Python, Ruby, Perl, Raku, Powershell
and Golang.

I can mix building of custom frameworks with use of well known systems and tools.

I not only write a code but make a solid system design and act as a ubiquitous mediator 
between ops, devs and architects.

I love to convert confusing and tangled systems into simple and easy to maintain.

I can and love write tests for all my code. From low level (unit test) to high level (integration and acceptance tests).

I am very systematic and attentive to details. I love and I can document my code.

I can work both with legacy systems, eventually bringing things in order, and 
yes I love to start  green fields projects :-)

I am familiar with system design patterns, algorithms and data structures.

I can always find a balance in spending my work time on creating a proper design, 
write quality code, sharing knowledge with other and writing a documentation.

I am the author of many open source automation frameworks 
and active member of Raku language community ([https://raku.org](https://raku.org), @melezhik)

Following is my job history and professional achievements for the last 15 years.
