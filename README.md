# Self introduction

I have a strong skill set related to platform engineering and devops.

I code on many programming languages including Python, Ruby, GoLang, Perl and Powershell.

I am the author of many open source automation frameworks and active member of Raku language community.

I do system design and implement existing solutions, wearing many hats at the same time.

I am very systematic and attentive to details. I love document my code in a simple and

easy to ready manner.

I can work both with legacy code, eventually bringing things in order and
starting green fields projects.

I am familiar with system design, algorithm and data structure concepts.

I can always  find a good balance between design, efficiency and code quality.
